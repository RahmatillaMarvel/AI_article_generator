**Abstract**
GenAI BETAWAY is a novel artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm that has been developed to assist in the prediction of horse race outcomes. The algorithm is based on a combination of machine learning and natural language processing techniques. It is trained on a large dataset of historical race data, and it uses this data to identify patterns and trends that can be used to make predictions.

**Introduction**
Horse racing has long been a popular sport, and there is a great deal of interest in developing methods that can be used to predict the outcome of races. Traditional methods of prediction rely on the analysis of past performance data, but these methods can be time-consuming and subjective. GenAI BETAWAY is a new AI algorithm that has been developed to automate the process of prediction and to provide more accurate results.

**GenAI BETAWAY Algorithm**

* The GenAI BETAWAY algorithm is a supervised learning algorithm. This means that it is trained on a dataset of labeled data. The dataset consists of historical race data, and each data point is labeled with the outcome of the race.
* The algorithm is trained using a variety of machine learning techniques, including linear regression, logistic regression, and decision trees. The algorithm is able to learn from the data and to identify patterns and trends that can be used to make predictions.
* Once the algorithm has been trained, it can be used to predict the outcome of new races. The algorithm takes as input a set of features, such as the horse's past performance, the jockey's record, and the weather conditions. The algorithm then uses these features to make a prediction about the outcome of the race.

**Results**
The GenAI BETAWAY algorithm has been tested on a large dataset of historical race data, and it has been shown to be able to predict the outcome of races with a high degree of accuracy. The algorithm is able to outperform traditional methods of prediction, and it is able to provide more accurate predictions even when the data is limited.

**Conclusion**
The GenAI BETAWAY algorithm is a powerful new tool that can be used to predict the outcome of horse races. The algorithm is able to learn from data and to identify patterns and trends that can be used to make predictions. The algorithm is able to outperform traditional methods of prediction, and it is able to provide more accurate predictions even when the data is limited.
